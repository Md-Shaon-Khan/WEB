Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:

{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here


Variables declared with varinside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:

{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here

Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with let.

With let you can not do this:

let x = "John Doe";

let x = 0;

Variables defined with var can be redeclared.

With var you can do this:

var x = "John Doe";

var x = 0;

Difference Between var, let and const
Scope	Redeclare	Reassign	Hoisted	Binds this
var	    No	        Yes	        Yes	    Yes	  Yes
let	    Yes	        No	        Yes  	No    No
const	Yes	        No	        No	    No	  No
